# JeaDscDatum

Composite resource for JeaDsc when using with Datum approach to configuration management.

There are two examples of this style of configuration management, you can see them at [DscInfraSample](https://github.com/gaelcolas/DscInfraSample) and [DscWorkshop](https://github.com/automatedlab/DscWorkshop). The goal with these is to store as much in configuration data files as possible and make use of composite resources to dynamically generate the resource configuration and therefore MOF from these configuration data files. There are more details on those two repositories.
